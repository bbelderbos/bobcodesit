# How to match overlapping strings in Python?

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for string matching. However, standard regex patterns might not capture overlapping matches.

This is where a positive lookahead (?=) comes in handy because it doesn't "consume" the characters allowing for multiple matches:

```
import re

# goal: match cat and at
text = "The catapult"

# without lookahead
matches = re.findall(r'cat|at', text)
print(f"{matches=}")  # matches=['cat']

# with lookahead
matches = re.findall(r'(?=(cat|at))', text)
print(f"{matches=}")  # matches=['cat', 'at']
```

- In the first case (re.findall(r'cat|at', text)), the regex engine stops at "cat" and doesn't consider "at" as a separate match because it's part of the already matched "cat".

- In the second case (re.findall(r'(?=(cat|at))', text)), the lookahead (?=...) ensures that the engine checks for "cat" or "at" at every position in the string without consuming the characters, allowing both "cat" and "at" to be matched even when they overlap.
