# Calculate similarity between two files

Using difflib it's easy to do. Here I use it to compare two files:

```
import difflib

# Open and read the contents of the first file
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file:
    file1_contents = file.read()

# Open and read the contents of the second file
with open('file2.txt', 'r') as file:
    file2_contents = file.read()

# Create a SequenceMatcher object and compare the two file contents
matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, file1_contents, file2_contents)

# Calculate the similarity (ratio)
similarity = matcher.ratio()

print(f"Similarity: {similarity * 100:.2f}%")
```
