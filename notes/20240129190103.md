# atexit

In Python you can use the atexit module for cleanup tasks or to gracefully shut down services when your script exits normally.

Simple + real world example ðŸ”¥

```
import atexit

def reset_all():
    print("Doing some reset operations")
    ...

atexit.register(reset_all)

# prints: Doing some reset operations
# and runs hidden code before exiting


# another example from TensorFlow's heartbeat.py:
_heartbeat_timer = threading.Event()

def stop_heartbeat():
    logging.info('Stopping the heartbeat thread')
    _heartbeat_timer.set()
    # Give the threads some time to clean up.
    time.sleep(max(period // 10, 2))

atexit.register(stop_heartbeat)
```

#atexit
