# Integer caching

In Python integers in the range -5...256 are cached.

As per the Integer Objects docs:

> "The current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all integers between -5 and 256, when you create an `int` in that range you actually just get back a reference to the existing object."

Note that `is` checks for object identity.

```
>>> a = [5, 200, 256, 257, 300, 500]
>>> b = [5, 200, 256, 257, 300, 500]
>>>
>>> for i, j in zip(a, b):
...     print(i, j, i is j)
...
5 5 True
200 200 True
256 256 True
257 257 False
300 300 False
500 500 False
```
