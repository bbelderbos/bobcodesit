# When to use classes in Python?

- State management: use classes when you need to keep track of data and actions. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios like managing complex user interactions or tracking real-time data in applications.

- For larger projects: classes help in organizing code and making it reusable.

- Encapsulation: classes allow you to hide details and expose only what's necessary. Note that unlike some other languages, Python adopts a more open approach, often favoring readability and simplicity over strict access control.

- Enforcing a contract: abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python can be used to ensure that certain methods are implemented in subclasses.

- Understanding Python better: since everything in Python is an object, knowing about classes and objects helps you write more efficient, idiomatic code. Having a good grasp on the data model (special / dunder methods) goes a long way.

Python's design philosophy supports multiple paradigms, allowing developers to choose the most fitting approach, whether it's procedural, functional, or object-oriented programming. 🐍 😍

🚫 Avoid using classes when:

- Your class is too simple, having only a constructor and one method (highly recommended: Jack Diederich's "Stop Writing Classes" talk)

- For small, one-off scripts where a class might be overkill.

- If a context manager or generator would be a simpler solution.

Overall I usually start with functions and refactor into classes later.

🔑 Main point: classes are great for organizing and maintaining related data and behaviors but in Python I would use them judiciously.
