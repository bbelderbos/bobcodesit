# dict() type constructor

Overall I prefer dictionary comprehensions but for some scenarios dict() can be useful, it accepts both a mapping as well as an iterable.

```
>>> s = "a=1,b=2"
>>> {row.split("=") for row in s.split(",")}
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
>>> {*row.split("=") for row in s.split(",")}
...
SyntaxError: iterable unpacking cannot be used in comprehension

>>> dict(row.split("=") for row in s.split(","))
{'a': '1', 'b': '2'}

# because dict() can take an iterable, only requirement is that the
# each element has two values (dict key + value)
>>> [row.split("=") for row in s.split(",")]
[['a', '1'], ['b', '2']]
```
