# install a package in editable mode

🔍 Did you know about the -e (editable) flag in pip install?

🔗 Use pip install -e . (or specify a path) to create a link to a package, rather than copying its code into your virtual environment.

💡 Benefit: changes made to the linked package are immediately active - no re-install needed!
