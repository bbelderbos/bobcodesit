# retry decorator

I suggested a decorator in a code review today. ðŸ˜Ž

Decorators are a clean way to abstract repeated logic â€” enriching functions without touching their core behavior. ðŸ’¡

In this example, we retry a flaky HTTP service with timeout logic. No more clunky while + try/except + sleep scattered everywhere. ðŸ“ˆ

```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "httpx",
# ]
# ///
from functools import wraps
import time

import httpx


def wait_for_service(*, attempts: int, delay: int):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for attempt in range(1, attempts + 1):
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception as e:
                    if attempt < attempts:
                        print(f"Retrying {func.__name__} (attempt {attempt}): {e}")
                        time.sleep(delay)
                    else:
                        raise RuntimeError(f"{func.__name__} timed out.") from e

        return wrapper

    return decorator


@wait_for_service(attempts=3, delay=2)
def check_httpbin():
    r = httpx.get("https://httpbin.org/status/503")
    r.raise_for_status()
    print("Service is ready!")


check_httpbin()

"""
Output:

```
