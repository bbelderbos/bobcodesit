# Temporary files / directories

Making a temporary file/directory is very useful for testing.

In the example below, we first use `TemporaryDirectory` to create 5 temp files.

This is a great example of using a context manager â€” a clean way to automatically clean up resources.

However, pytest has a built-in fixture for this: `tmp_path`, which makes it even cleaner.

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

import pytest


def count_dirs_and_files(directory_path: str = '.' ) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Function for counting dirs and files in a directory."""
    dirs, files = 0, 0
    for _, directories, filenames in os.walk(directory_path):
        dirs += len(directories)
        files += len(filenames)
    return dirs, files


def test_only_files():
    with TemporaryDirectory(dir="/tmp") as dirname:
        for i in range(1, 6):
            (Path(dirname) / f'{i}.txt').write_text('hello')
        assert count_dirs_and_files(dirname) == (0, 5)

# refactored using pytest's tmp_path fixture + parametrize

@pytest.mark.parametrize("num_files", [1, 5, 10])
def test_only_files_param(tmp_path, num_files):
    for i in range(1, num_files + 1):
        (tmp_path / f'{i}.txt').write_text('hello')
    assert count_dirs_and_files(tmp_path) == (0, num_files)
```
