# pretty print to a file

I was in the Python debugger today and I was wondering how to write a sorted dictionary to a file while there. ðŸ’ª

And then I learned that pprint's `PrettyPrinter` can stream to a file, nice! ðŸ˜Ž

Here is how:

```
import pprint

# sort by numeric value descending (here: most listened podcast episodes)
sorted_stats = sorted(stats.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# pretty print the dict to a text file
with open('sorted_stats.txt', 'w') as file:
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(stream=file, indent=4)
    pp.pprint(sorted_stats)
```

#pprint
