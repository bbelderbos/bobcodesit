# Computed (and readonly) fields / attributes

An elegant way to define computed attributes in Python is by using the @ property decorator (similar to getters and setters in other languages).

These are attributes that are not actually stored, but computed on demand.

In the code below, we use it to see if a promotion has expired by calling the expired property on the object.

Pretty neat, no?

```
>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta

>>> class Promo:
...     def __init__(self, name, expires=None):
...         self.name = name
...         self.expires = expires or datetime.now()
...     @property
...     def expired(self):
...         return datetime.now() > self.expires
...

>>> promo = Promo('Halloween', expires=datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=5))
>>> promo.expired
False
# wait 5 seconds
>>> promo.expired
True
```

#property #oops
