# Composition over Inheritance

Increase flexibility and reusability, reduce coupling, and avoid complex class inheritance issues.

The 'composition over inheritance' design pattern can really simplify your codebase. 🛠️💡

```
# multiple inheritance

class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Student(User):
    def study(self):
        return "Studying"

class Teacher(User):
    def teach(self):
        return "Teaching"

class TeachingAssistant(Student, Teacher):  # complexity 😱
    pass


# composition

class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Learner:
    def study(self):
        return "Studying"

class Instructor:
    def teach(self):
        return "Teaching"

class TeachingAssistant:

    # this class can perform both roles as needed without inheriting
    # from Student or Teacher.-> reduced coupling and easier to maintain

    def __init__(self, name):
        # avoiding inheritance complications
        self.user = User(name)
        self.learner = Learner()
        self.instructor = Instructor()

    def study(self):
        return self.learner.study()

    def teach(self):
        return self.instructor.teach()
```
