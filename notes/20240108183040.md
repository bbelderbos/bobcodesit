# Use underscores to make numbers more readable

Did you know you can make big numbers more readable in Python using underscores?

This feature, available from v3.6, lets you visually group digits in large numbers.

```
# Example with an integer
a = 1_000_000_000  # Much easier to read than 1000000000
b = 1000000000
print(a == b)  # Outputs: True

# Works with floats too
c = 10_000_000.123_456
d = 10000000.123456
print(c == d)  # Outputs: True

# It helps in making sense of long binary, octal or hex values as well
binary_num = 0b1010_1111_0101_1100
octal_num = 0o2_345_671
hex_num = 0x1A_2B_3C_4D
```
