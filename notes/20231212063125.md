# Easy caching in Python 🐍 😍

You can use the @cache decorator as a “simple lightweight unbounded function cache”.

The classic example is calculating a Fibonacci series where the intermediate results are cached, speeding up the calculation significantly:

```
from functools import cache

@cache
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

for i in range(40):
    print(fibonacci(i))

# runtime without vs with @cache = 28.30s / 0.02s 😎
```

Note that `@cache` is just a wrapper around the still existing `@lru_cache`, calling it with a `maxsize` of `None`.
