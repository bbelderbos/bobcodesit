# tuples are immutable

A nice feature of tuples is that they are immutable so values in the collection cannot be overriden, you would have to make a new object. This can lead to safer code (aka data integrity):

```
>>> numbers = list(range(1, 11))
>>> numbers
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> type(numbers)
<class 'list'>
>>> numbers[6] = "spam"  # might not always be desired
>>> numbers
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 'spam', 8, 9, 10]
>>> numbers = tuple(range(1, 11))
>>> numbers
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
>>> type(numbers)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> numbers[6] = "spam"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
