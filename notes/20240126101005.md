# itertools.cycle

You can use `itertools.cycle` when you need to infinitely repeat a series of actions in a loop (`itertools.cycle` creates an infinite iterator).

In this example, we use it to toggle lights in a repeating sequence. We consume only 6 elements for demonstration.

`_` denotes a "throwaway" variable because its value isn't needed.

```
import itertools

colors = itertools.cycle(['red', 'green', 'blue'])

for _ in range(6):
    print(next(colors))

# red green blue red green blue
```

#itertools
