# Counter for tracking multiple states

Use Counter to track quantities across multiple states in #Python 👇

```python
from collections import Counter

def simulate_beams(grid: list[str]) -> int:
    """Simulate light beams splitting as they move through grid."""
    # Track number of beams at each column position
    beams = Counter({0: 1})  # Start with 1 beam at column 0
    total_splits = 0

    for row in grid:
        new_beams = Counter()
        for col, count in beams.items():
            if row[col] == "^":  # Splitter
                total_splits += 1
                # Beam splits into two
                new_beams[col - 1] += count
                new_beams[col + 1] += count
            else:  # Continue straight
                new_beams[col] += count
        beams = new_beams

    return total_splits

# Example:
grid = [".....", "..^..", ".....", ".^..."]
print(simulate_beams(grid))  # Counts beam splits
```

Counter arithmetic (`+=`) handles aggregation automatically. Perfect for simulations!
