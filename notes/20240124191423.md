# removesuffix and removeprefix

Use `removeprefix` / `removesuffix` methods (>= 3.9 🐍) to safely remove prefixes and suffixes from strings. 🚀

Benefits:

• Presence check: it ensures the suffix is present before attempting to remove it.

• Explicitness: it explicitly specifies which suffix to remove, thus avoiding ambiguity.

• More readable: clearly named methods. 😍

```
# Less safe, assumes the name is formatted like '[index]'
name = name[1:-1]

# Safer and better: removes [ and ] only if they are present
name = name.removesuffix('[').removesuffix(']')

# Another advantage: no need for indexing and slicing
filename = "prefix_data.csv"
if filename.startswith("prefix_"):
    filename = filename[len("prefix_"):]

# Less code and safer:
filename = filename.removeprefix("prefix_")

# For files you can use `pathlib` to strip the suffix:
from pathlib import Path
Path("file.csv").stem  # returns 'file'
```
