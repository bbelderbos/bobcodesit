# removesuffix and removeprefix

Use `removesuffix` for safe suffix removal in Python 3.9+ (there's also `removeprefix`) 🐍

Benefits:

• Presence check: it ensures the suffix is present before attempting to remove it.

• Explicitness: it explicitly specifies which suffix to remove, thus avoidiang ambiguity.

• More readable: clearly named methods. 😍

```
# Less safe:
# Assuming the name is formatted like '[index]'
name = name[1:-1]

# Safer and better:
# Remove '[' prefix and ']' suffix if they are present
name = name.remaoveprefix('[').removesuffix(']')
```
