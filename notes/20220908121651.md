# testing floats with pytest's approx()

Sometimes you need a bit of tolerance in your tests, for example when dealing with floats.

pytest's approx() asserts that two numbers (or two sets of numbers) are equal to each other within some tolerance which is perfect for this:

```
$ more script.py
def sum_numbers(*numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

$ more test.py
from script import sum_numbers

def test_sum_numbers_ints():
    assert sum_numbers(1, 2, 3) == 6

def test_sum_numbers_floats():
    assert sum_numbers(0.1, 0.2) == 0.3  # uh-oh

$ pytest test.py
...
E       assert 0.30000000000000004 == 0.3
E        +  where 0.30000000000000004 = sum_numbers(0.1, 0.2)
...
1 failed, 1 passed in 0.06s

$ more test.py
from pytest import approx
...
def test_sum_numbers_floats():
    assert sum_numbers(0.1, 0.2) == approx(0.3)  # this passes
```
