# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

- Loop with counter? Use `enumerate()` for clean and readable indexing.

- Variable swap? Tuple unpacking makes it a one-liner.

- String formatting? F-strings offer clarity and conciseness.

- Counting elements? `collections.Counter()` simplifies counting occurrences.

- Signifying a 'no value'? `None` is the clear and standard choice for `null` in Python.

- Creating a sequence of numbers? `range()` is straightforward and memory-efficient.

- Caching results of function calls? Use the `@functools.cache` decorator.

- Dictionary retrieval with default? `dict.get()` elegantly handles missing keys.

However, in some cases, the 'obvious way' isn't always clear-cut:

- Use map/filter vs list comprehension? -> While list comprehensions are often more readable, `map` and `filter` can be more concise and memory-efficient due to their lazy evaluation.

- Use the Walrus operator (`:=`)? -> Offers conciseness but can it compromise readability?

- Use `*args` and `**kwargs`? -> They provide flexibility, but does this go against the principle of "explicit is better than implicit"?

- Use type hints -> They can catch bugs early and make code more expressive, but do they add verbosity and challenge Pythonâ€™s dynamic nature?

Overall, in most cases, I find there is one obvious way, and it's what makes Python intuitive, elegant, and easier to maintain.
