# set operations

Set operations are a powerful feature, they will make your code more concise (see example below - no loops!)

And as sets are implemented using hash tables, you can generally expect O(1) performance ğŸ˜®

```
>>> old_students = {"Bob", "Julian", "Tim"}
>>> new_students = {"Julian", "Sarah"}
>>> students_left = old_students - new_students
>>> students_left
{'Tim', 'Bob'}
>>> students_joined = new_students - old_students
>>> students_joined
{'Sarah'}
>>> students_in_common = old_students & new_students
>>> students_in_common
{'Julian'}
>>> students_uniq_to_each = old_students ^ new_students
>>> students_uniq_to_each
{'Sarah', 'Tim', 'Bob'}
>>> # alternative notations
>>> old_students.difference(new_students)
{'Tim', 'Bob'}
>>> new_students.difference(old_students)
{'Sarah'}
>>> new_students.intersection(old_students)
{'Julian'}
>>> new_students.symmetric_difference(old_students)
{'Tim', 'Sarah', 'Bob'}
>>> # another useful method
>>> {"Bob", "Julian"}.issubset(old_students)
True
```
