# Priority queues made simple with heapq

Need to schedule tasks by urgency or priority?

Python’s heapq module has you covered, it maintains a min-heap, so each heappop() gives you the lowest (i.e. most urgent) priority first.

Perfect for job queues, schedulers, or any “what should I do next?” 

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

tasks = []
heappush(tasks, (2, "write docs"))
heappush(tasks, (1, "fix bug"))
heappush(tasks, (3, "refactor code"))

while tasks:
    _, job = heappop(tasks)
    print(f"Now doing: {job}")

# Output:
# Now doing: fix bug
# Now doing: write docs
# Now doing: refactor code
```
