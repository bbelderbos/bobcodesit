# Run pytest tests in parallel

Cool trick I picked up from Brian Okken's book: how to run tests in parallel using pytest-xdist 🐍

```
(venv) $ pip install pytest-xdist pytest-repeat

(venv) $ cat test_script.py
import time
import pytest

def test_something():
    time.sleep(1)  # simulating a longer-running test

(venv) $ pytest --count=10 -q
..........                                                                                                                                                                     [100%]
10 passed in 10.04s

(venv) $ pytest --count=10 -n=4 -q
bringing up nodes...
..........                                                                                                                                                                     [100%]
10 passed in 3.54s
```

😍

• --count is from the repeat plugin to run test multiple times (for example sake),

• -n is the amount of workers to run the tests in parallel with (use `-n=auto` to have pytest automatically determine the number of workers to use based on the number of CPU cores available on your machine), and

• -q is to show less output, only the final result + timing

Nice performance gain, especially beneficial in CI/CD pipelines and during development when running large test suites. 📈
