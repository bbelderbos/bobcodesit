# while else

You can use an `else` on a `while` loop which will hit if the loop runs normally. If the loop is terminated prematurely though (using `break` or `return`), the code in the `else` won't execute. This construct can also be used with a `for` loop.

```
>>> while True:
...     break
... else:
...     print("hits")
...
>>> a = True
>>> while a:
...     a = False
... else:
...     print("hits")
...
hits
```
