# while else

You can use an else on a while loop which will hit if the loop runs normally. When the condition becomes False and the loop runs normally, the else clause will execute. However, if the loop is terminated prematurely by either a break or return statement, the else clause wonâ€™t execute at all.

```
>>> while True:
...     break
... else:
...     print("hits")
...
>>> a = True
>>> while a:
...     a = False
... else:
...     print("hits")
...
hits
```
