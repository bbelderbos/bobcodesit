# Regex replacements and counting

Here is how to replace all vowels from a text while keeping a count of the number of replacements made:

```
>>> import re
>>> vowels = 'aeiou'
>>> text = """

... """
>>> new_string, number_of_subs_made = re.subn(f'[{vowels}]', '*', text, flags=re.I)
>>> new_string[:10]
'\nTh* Z*n *'
>>> number_of_subs_made
262
```

You can use re.subn() to do regex replacing. It returns a tuple of the new (replaced) string and the number of replacements made.
