# Matrix transposition with zip

Elegant way to transpose a matrix (swap rows/columns) in #Python 👇

```python
from math import prod

# Original grid (rows)
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]
]

# Transpose: rows become columns
transposed = list(zip(*grid))
print(transposed)
# [(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]

# Practical example: column operations
ops = ["*", "+", "*", "+"]

# Process each column with its operation
result = sum(
    prod(col) if op == "*" else sum(col)
    for op, col in zip(ops, transposed)
)
print(result)  # (1*5*9) + (2+6+10) + (3*7*11) + (4+8+12) = 45 + 18 + 231 + 24

# Remember: zip(*matrix) unpacks rows as arguments to zip
# which pairs up elements at same index = columns!
```

#matrix #zip
