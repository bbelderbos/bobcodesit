# How old is Pybites?

(written the 19th of Dec 2023)

It's the 19th of December again today and that means:

Happy birthday Pybites, today you turn 7 🎂 🎉

```
from datetime import date

from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta


def is_birthday(today, birth_date):
    return today.month == birth_date.month and today.day == birth_date.day


if __name__ == "__main__":
    today = date.today()
    birth_date = date(2016, 12, 19)

    if is_birthday(today, birth_date):
        age = relativedelta(today, birth_date).years
        print(f"Happy birthday @Pybites, today you turn {age} 🎂 🎉")
    else:
        print("No birthday cake today.")
```
