# Determining a module's source

Ever wonder where a Python module is imported from?

You can use the `__file__` attribute to find the file path of the module.

```
# For standard modules
import os
print(os.__file__)
# '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/os.py'

# For third-party modules
import requests
print(requests.__file__)
# '/Users/bbelderbos/code/codechalleng.es/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/requests/__init__.py'
```

Note that these paths will vary based on your environment, and that for some built-in modules (e.g. `sys`), the `__file__` attribute may not be available.
