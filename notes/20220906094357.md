# itertools.count

itertools.count() makes an iterator that returns evenly spaced values starting from a number. You can also give it a "step" argument.

```
>>> from itertools import count
>>> gen = count()
>>> next(gen)
0
>>> next(gen)
1
>>> gen = count(10)
>>> next(gen)
10
>>> next(gen)
11
>>> gen = count(5, step=5)
>>> next(gen)
5
>>> next(gen)
10
```
