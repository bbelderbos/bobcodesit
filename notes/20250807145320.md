# string enum

Ever wondered why your enum comparison in Python didn't work?

Maybe you were comparing the enum 'object' to a string?

With regular Enum, this can fail silently.

Python 3.11 introduced `StrEnum` which fixes this by making enum members behave like strings.

âœ… No more .value juggling
âœ… Clean, readable comparisons

Worth using if you're on 3.11+

Or do you think we should always use `is` when comparing enums? ðŸ‘‡

```
from enum import Enum, StrEnum

class Role(Enum):
    ADMIN = "admin"

print(Role.ADMIN == "admin")         # False!
print(Role.ADMIN.value == "admin")   # True

class Role(StrEnum):
    ADMIN = "admin"

print(Role.ADMIN == "admin")         # True ðŸŽ¯
```

#enum
