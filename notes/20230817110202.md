# Make an entry point to your Python package

1️⃣ Organize your package:

```
mypackage/
│
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
└── module2.py
```

2️⃣ Create a __main__.py file:

```
mypackage/
│
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
├── module2.py
└── __main__.py
```

3️⃣ Add your entry point code to __main__.py:

```
# main.py
from .module1 import my_function

my_function()
```

-> We tend to not use `if __name__ == '__main__':` in this module since this file is specifically intended to be the entry point of a package, and it is understood that the code it contains is what should run when the package is executed as a script. 💡

4️⃣ Run the package:

```
$ python -m mypackage
```

#packaging
