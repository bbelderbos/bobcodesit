# FIFO vs LIFO

Using the right data structure matters ðŸ’¡

> "Popping from the left on a deque is an O(1) operation, whereas it is an O(n) operation on a list. In the case of the list, after popping from the left, every subsequent element must be moved one to the left, making it inefficient"

- from "Classic Computer Science Problems in Python"

ðŸš€ Takeaway:

â€¢ FIFO (first in â†’ first out) = 'queue' = use a collections.deque() for fast popleft()

â€¢ LIFO (last in â†’ first out) = 'stack' = a list works fine since append() / pop() on the right are fast

```python
from collections import deque
from timeit import timeit

lst = list(range(100_000))
dq = deque(range(100_000))


def ms(sec):
    return f"{sec * 1000:.3f} ms"


list_time = timeit("lst.pop(0)", globals=globals(), number=1000)
deque_time = timeit("dq.popleft()", globals=globals(), number=1000)

print("list pop(0):", ms(list_time))
print("deque popleft:", ms(deque_time))

# list pop(0): 21.601 ms
# deque popleft: 0.034 ms
```

#deque
