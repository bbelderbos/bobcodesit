# a powerful parser

What if you have to split by words, but need to keep words together that are in double quotes? Enter the shlex module:

```
>>> s = """pybites "code challenges" community "data science" development"""

# split on space won't work
>>> s.split()
['pybites', '"code', 'challenges"', 'community', '"data', 'science"', 'development']

# enter shlex
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split(s)
['pybites', 'code challenges', 'community', 'data science', 'development']

# if it was not for shlex
>>> import re
>>> [element.strip('"') for element in re.findall(r'"[^"]*"|[^"\W]+', s)]
['pybites', 'code challenges', 'community', 'data science', 'development']
```

This might seem easier than it really is, but in reality solving this problem often leads to complex regular expressions like shown in the code block above.

As you can see shlex is ideal for this scenario and it is yet another gem of Python's Standard Library.

Today I was poking a bit into the python-decouple source and saw Csv() uses it as well:

```
class Csv(object):
    """
    Produces a csv parser that return a list of transformed elements.
    """

    def __init__(self, cast=text_type, delimiter=',', strip=string.whitespace, post_process=list):
        """
        Parameters:
        cast -- callable that transforms the item just before it's added to the list.
        delimiter -- string of delimiters chars passed to shlex.
        strip -- string of non-relevant characters to be passed to str.strip after the split.
        post_process -- callable to post process all casted values. Default is `list`.
        """
        self.cast = cast
        self.delimiter = delimiter
        self.strip = strip
        self.post_process = post_process

    def __call__(self, value):
        """The actual transformation"""
        if value is None:
            return self.post_process()

        transform = lambda s: self.cast(s.strip(self.strip))

        splitter = shlex(value, posix=True)
        splitter.whitespace = self.delimiter
        splitter.whitespace_split = True

        return self.post_process(transform(s) for s in splitter)
```
