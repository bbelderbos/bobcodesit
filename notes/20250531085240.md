# Simplify layered dict lookups with ChainMap

Problem: you need to look up a key across multiple dictionaries in priority order — later groups should override earlier ones. Nesting `.get()`s works but becomes messy and hard to maintain.

👉 `ChainMap` (from the awesome collections module) gives you one logical view over multiple dicts — elegant fallback without nesting.

```
from collections import ChainMap

group1 = {'tim': 30, 'bob': 17, 'ana': 24}
group2 = {'ana': 26, 'thomas': 64, 'helen': 26}
group3 = {'brenda': 17, 'otto': 44, 'thomas': 46}

# ❌ Clunky manual fallback logic
name = "ana"
age = group3.get(name, group2.get(name, group1.get(name)))
print(age)  # 26 → from group2, overrides group1

# ✅ Clean and scalable with ChainMap
m = ChainMap(group3, group2, group1)
age = m.get("ana")
print(age)  # 26 → from group2, overrides group1

age = m.get("thomas")
print(age)  # 46 → from group3, overrides group2
```
