# How to read from standard input (stdin) in Python?

You can use the sys module to read standard input in Python? üêç

```
# script.py
import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()
    print(line)
```

Example usage:

```
$ echo "line1\nline2\nline3\n" | python script.py
line1
line2
line3
```

---

For people newer to Unix:

1. The echo commands sends 3 lines to standard output.

2. It then pipes this into another command, in this case python which runs script.py.

3. The output becomes standard input to that script (which code consumes it).
