# Binary search

Binary search in Python? Don’t write it yourself.

`bisect` finds insertion points in sorted lists with O(log n) search. Use `insort` to insert while maintaining order (insertion is O(n) due to shifting).

Great for grade calculators, leaderboards, or finding range boundaries in sorted data.

If your data is sorted, `bisect` is your friend.

```python
import bisect


# Grade calculator
def get_grade(score):
    breakpoints = [60, 70, 80, 90]
    grades = "FDCBA"
    return grades[bisect.bisect(breakpoints, score)]


print(get_grade(85))  # B
print(get_grade(92))  # A
print(get_grade(55))  # F

# Insert while keeping sorted
data = [1, 3, 5, 7]
bisect.insort(data, 4)  # [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
```
