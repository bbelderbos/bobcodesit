# string methods over regular expressions

Often you don't need a regex, Python's string methods cover a lot!

```
>>> import re
>>> words = ("how", "are", "you", "today")
>>> for word in words:
...     if re.match(r".*(o[uw])$", word):  # ðŸ¤”
...         word
...
'how'
'you'
>>> # str.endswith() (and str.startswith()) can also receive
>>> # a tuple of prefixes to look for:
>>> for word in words:
...     if word.endswith(("ow", "ou")):
...         word
...
'how'
'you'
```
