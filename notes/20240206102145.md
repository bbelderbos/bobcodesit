# getattr for safely access attributes

`getattr` is useful for safely accessing attributes in Python, providing a default return value to prevent `AttributeError`.

I used it here to deal with diverse data sources, such as RSS feeds that may use different attributes for timestamps.

```
class Command(BaseCommand):

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        ...
        for url in urls:
            feed = feedparser.parse(url)
            for entry in feed.entries:
                published = getattr(entry, "published_parsed", None)
                updated = getattr(entry, "updated_parse", None)
                if published is None and updated is None:
                    continue  # Skip entries without valid dates
```
