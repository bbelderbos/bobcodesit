# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Consider the `capitalize_words()` function below. It uniformly uses the `.capitalize()` method for all words in a string, regardless of their original case.

This approach exemplifies the principle by avoiding special handling for cases like acronyms or words that are already capitalized.

This uniform treatment keeps the code simple and consistent, highlighting the elegance of Python's design philosophy. üêç üòÅ

```
def capitalize_words(s):
    # no extra ifs, one consistent interface
    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())

print(capitalize_words("hello world"))  # Outputs "Hello World"
print(capitalize_words("python is FUN"))  # Outputs "Python Is Fun"
```
