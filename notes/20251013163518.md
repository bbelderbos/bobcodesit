# divmod built-in

Ever needed both integer division (`//`) and remainder (`%`)? 🤔

Instead of running two operations, use hashtag#Python’s `divmod()` built-in -> it returns both in one go ⚡️

```python
>>> total_seconds = 133
>>> minutes, seconds = divmod(total_seconds, 60)
>>> minutes
2
>>> seconds
13
```
