# Retrieving GitHub Issue Comments with PyGithub

You can use PyGithub to load issue comments from a GitHub repository.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to fetch and print the title, URL, and comments of a specific issue from a GitHub repository:

```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "pygithub",
# ]
# ///
import os

from github import Auth, Github

REPO = "pybites/challenges"
ISSUE_NUMBER = 609  # "Mapping"

# $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
gh = Github(auth=Auth.Token(os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]))
repo = gh.get_repo(REPO)
issue = repo.get_issue(number=ISSUE_NUMBER)

print(f"{issue.title} — {issue.html_url}\n")
for c in issue.get_comments():
    print(f"- {c.user.login} ({c.created_at:%Y-%m-%d})\n{c.body}\n")

"""
$ uv run script.py
