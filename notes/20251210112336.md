# get elements common to all groups

Set operations are so concise in #Python 🐍😍

Here's a neat way to get the characters that appear in every group 👇

`set.intersection(*...)` returns the items that exist in all given sets. It can take multiple sets as arguments, which we “splat” (`*`) unpack from a generator expression here.

```
def common_chars(groups: list[str]) -> int:
    common = set(groups[0])
    for group in groups[1:]:
        common &= set(group)
    return len(common)

# after
def common_chars(groups: list[str]) -> int:
    common = set.intersection(*(set(g) for g in groups))
    return len(common)

# Example:
# common_chars(["abc", "ac", "adc"]) -> 2   # {"a", "c"}
#                ^^^^^^^  ^^^
#           only "a" and "c" are in all groups
```

#sets
