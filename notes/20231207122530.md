# Get the Zen of Python into variable(s)

Ever wondered how to get the Zen of #Python into a string?

TIL about the codecs (Python Codec Registry) module that is useful to convert between different character encodings, like UTF-8, ASCII, etc.

```
import this
import codecs

zen_of_python = codecs.decode(this.s, 'rot13')

for line in zen_of_python.splitlines()[2:]:
    print(line)
```

#zen #codecs
