# is vs ==

What is the difference between 'is' and '==' in #Python? 🐍 💡

🔶 `is` checks that 2 arguments refer to the same object.

🔶`==` is used to check that they have the same value.

So given two lists and this assignment:

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> c = a
```

We can see the difference here:

```
>>> a == b # same content
True
>>> a == c # also same content
True
```

However:

```
>>> a is c # same object
True
>>> a is b # not the same object
False
```

a is c, because they point to same list object in memory. 🤯

Usually `==` is what you want, but there are two cases where I use `is` 📈

- singletons (`None`, `True`, `False`)
- enums
