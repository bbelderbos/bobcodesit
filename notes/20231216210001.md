# split a sequence into pairs

Need to split a sequence into pairs? Try slicing with a step!

Quickly pair up elements in a list using zip combined with slicing:

```
numbers = range(1, 11)
pairs = list(zip(numbers[::2], numbers[1::2]))
print(pairs)  # [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)]
``

You can also use a generator function. This method can be particularly useful if you're dealing with big data, as it doesn't require creating intermediate lists:

```
def chunk_pairs(iterable):
    """Yield successive non-overlapping pairs from the iterable."""
    iterator = iter(iterable)
    for first in iterator:
        try:
            second = next(iterator)
            yield (first, second)
        except StopIteration:
            return

numbers = range(1, 11)
pairs = list(chunk_pairs(numbers))
print(pairs)  # [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)]
```

This function works by iterating over the provided iterable two elements at a time. It's efficient for large data sets because it doesn't create additional lists or slices. The StopIteration exception is used to gracefully handle iterables with an odd number of elements.

Since 3.12 you can also do this with `itertools.batched()` - from the docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.batched ->

```
flattened_data = ['roses', 'red', 'violets', 'blue', 'sugar', 'sweet']
unflattened = list(batched(flattened_data, 2))
unflattened
[('roses', 'red'), ('violets', 'blue'), ('sugar', 'sweet')]
```

Or to group by 3 items:

```
for batch in batched('ABCDEFG', 3):
    print(batch)

('A', 'B', 'C')
('D', 'E', 'F')
('G',)
```
