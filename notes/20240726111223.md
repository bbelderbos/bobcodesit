# You can now use | for typing

`|` got added to type hints >= 3.10, not needing the `typing` import anymore:

- Unions can now be written as `X | Y`
- Optional can now be written as `X | None`

```
typing import Union, Optional

def func(x: Union[int, str]) -> Optional[int]:
    pass


# >= 3.10

# no more typing import needed

def func(x: int | str) -> int | None:
    pass
```

#typing
