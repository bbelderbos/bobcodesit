# method resolution order

Did you know that `__mro__` gives you the 'method resolution order' of a class?

This is essentially the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes, quick example:
```
class Base:
    pass

class A(Base):
    pass

class B(Base):
    pass

class C(A, B):
    pass

from pprint import pprint as pp
pp(C.__mro__)

"""
(<class '__main__.C'>,
 <class '__main__.A'>,
 <class '__main__.B'>,
 <class '__main__.Base'>,
 <class 'object'>)
 """
```
