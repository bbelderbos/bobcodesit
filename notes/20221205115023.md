# Django form save commit kwarg

If you want to add extra attributes when saving a ModelForm, you can save the form with `commit=False`. I commonly use this to set a foreign key field for example.

```
if form.is_valid()  # some Django ModelForm object
    bite = form.save(commit=False)
    bite.user = request.user  # set the user foreign key field
    bite.save()
```
