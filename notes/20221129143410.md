# prevent file overwriting

You can open a file with 'x' (exclusive creation) to prevent overwriting it if it already exists.

```
>>> with open("file", "w") as f:
...     f.write("some text\n")
...
10
>>> with open("file", "w") as f:
...     f.write("other text\n")
...
11

# oops
>>> with open("file") as f:
...     f.read()
...
'other text\n'

# prevent overwriting existing file
>>> with open("file", "x") as f:
...     f.write("yet other text\n")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'file'
```
