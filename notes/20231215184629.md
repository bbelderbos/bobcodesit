# Although practicality beats purity.

Contradictory to "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules."

For example ... Rule: be explicit in catching exceptions.

However sometimes you also want to make sure that you catch everything, for example when dealing with external API calls or when integrating with other libraries, where the range of potential exceptions can be vast and unpredictable.

So being pragmatic you might end up writing an "except Exception: ..." instead of being more specific (e.g. catching multiple except SpecificException's)

Another example that comes to mind is *args and **kwargs, where best practices ("explicit is better than implicit", "keep your interfaces small") may be bent for practical purposes, e.g. to keep your design more flexible.
