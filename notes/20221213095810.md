# turn strings into operations (without eval)

The other day (in the AoC) I was given strings like "1 + 2" and "3 * 4".

How do you perform these operations without using eval()?

You can use the operator module in Python:

```
>>> a = "1 + 2"
>>> b = "3 * 4"
>>> import operator
>>> ops = {"+": operator.add, "*": operator.mul}
>>> for line in (a, b):
...     num1, op, num2 = line.split()
...     num1 = int(num1)
...     num2 = int(num2)
...     result = ops[op](num1, num2)
...     print(num1, num2, result)
...
1 2 3
3 4 12
```

#operator
