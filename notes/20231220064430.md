# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

This statement emphasizes clarity and explicitness in Python's design and usage. 🐍 😍

Here are some examples:

- Explicit exceptions: Python prefers explicit error handling over implicit assumptions.

- Python modules tend to use clear and descriptive names for functions, methods, and classes.

- Python's standard library design choices, e.g.
  - Having one special keyword, None, to represent null values.
  - Having mandatory indentation ensuring the structure of the code is always clear and unambiguous.
  - Not allowing implicit type conversions where such conversions might introduce ambiguity, for example, concatenating strings and numbers requires explicit conversion, avoiding implicit and potentially confusing behavior (JS on the other  hand does allow implicit type coercion!) *1

- Type hints provide a way to explicitly state the expected types of function arguments and return values.

- Bonus: Python makes it easy to have its Zen front and centre, just type "import this" in the REPL 😄

JavaScript does implicit type coercion:

console.log(1 + "2"); // Output: "12"

This can lead to unexpected results.

In Python we refuse the temptation to guess:

>>> a = 1
>>> b = "2"
>>> a + b
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

Be explicit (related to 'Explicit is better than implicit'): in this case, cast to int or str as needed:

>>> a + int(b)  # casts 'b' to int
3

Or to str:

>>> str(a) + b  # casts 'a' to str
'12'
