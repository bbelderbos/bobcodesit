# f-string debugging technique

Since Python 3.8 an = specifier was added to f-strings so that it will show both the variable name as well as the value it holds, for example:

```
>>> day = "Sunday"
>>> temperature_in_celsius = 28
>>> f"{day=}"
"day='Sunday'"
>>> f"{temperature_in_celsius=}"
'temperature_in_celsius=28'
```
