# pathlib / operator overloading

Ever wondered how pathlib.Path() overloads the "/" in an operation like:

Path(dirname) / filename

According to this SO answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/53085465, the Path class implements the __truediv__ dunder method.

The power of Python's data model!

(Code snippet from SO thread)

```
>>> class WeirdThing(object):
        def __truediv__(self, other):
            return 'Division!'

>>> WeirdThing() / WeirdThing()
'Division!'
```
