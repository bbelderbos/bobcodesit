# iterators are consumed once

ğŸ§  Python gotcha: iterators are consumed once! ğŸ’¡

Ever used `reversed(range(N))` and wondered why your inner loop only runs once?

ğŸ‘‰ Because `reversed(range(...))` returns an iterator and iterators are lazy, single-use.

ğŸ“Œ See example below: after the first pass, itâ€™s exhausted. Reusing it wonâ€™t work unless you wrap it in list():

âœ… `cols = list(reversed(range(4)))`

Python's laziness is great for performance, but if you're looping multiple times, cast to a list or similar to avoid silent bugs. ğŸ’¡

Has this ever bitten you? ğŸ¤”

```
cols = reversed(range(4))
for row in range(4):
    for col in cols:
        print(row, col)

# Output:
# Only the first row prints because `cols` is an exhausted iterator after one use
# 0 3
# 0 2
# 0 1
# 0 0
```
