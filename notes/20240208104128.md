# setattr for setting attributes

The other day I had a tip about `getattr()` to get attributes in Python.

Its counterpart is `setattr()` to, you guessed it, set attributes.

We find this for example in the sqlmodel docs when handling a patch request:

https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/update/?h=setattr#update-the-hero-in-the-database

-> `setattr()` takes an object, like the db_hero, then an attribute name (key), that in our case could be "name", and a value (value), and then it sets the attribute with that name to the value.

Why not just use dot notation you might wonder?
E.g. `db_hero.name = "Deadpuddle"`?

Here are some reasons:

1. When you don't know in advance which attributes you'll need to set or update (dynamically manipulating attributes of classes / instances at runtime is used in metaprogramming for example).

2. Using `setattr()` in a loop, like in the sqlmodel docs example below, reduces code.

3. `setattr()` can make your code more abstract and generic.

‚ö†Ô∏èCaution: while `setattr()` is powerful, use it with care. Avoid creating attributes with non-descriptive names or in an uncontrolled manner, as this can lead to code that's hard to read and maintain. Always strive for clarity and predictability in your attribute naming. üí°

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Query
from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select

...

@app.patch("/heroes/{hero_id}", response_model=HeroRead)
def update_hero(hero_id: int, hero: HeroUpdate):
    with Session(engine) as session:
        db_hero = session.get(Hero, hero_id)
        if not db_hero:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Hero not found")
        hero_data = hero.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)
        for key, value in hero_data.items():
            setattr(db_hero, key, value)
        session.add(db_hero)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(db_hero)
        return db_hero
```
