# namedtuple + type hints

Make a namedtuple with type hints üòç

```
from typing import NamedTuple

class Karma(NamedTuple):
    giver: str
    receiver: str
    score: int

# for this line:
# Karma('bob', 'julian', '5')
# mypy gives:
# Argument 3 to "Karma" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
karma = Karma('bob', 'julian', 5)  # ok
```

Typed NamedTuples in Python are a game-changer:

‚Ä¢ Readable + Ease of Use: Attribute access enhances readability and simplifies code.

‚Ä¢ Safety: Their immutable nature, combined with type checks, adds a layer of safety.

‚Ä¢ Tuple Unpacking: Retains all the benefits of regular tuple unpacking for versatility.
