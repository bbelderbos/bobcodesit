# check Python's version

You can use sys.version_info to check the Python version that is running.

Sometimes I see it compared to a (major, minor) tuple to use certain features based on version:

>>> import sys
>>> sys.version_info
sys.version_info(major=3, minor=10, micro=0, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
>>> tuple(sys.version_info)
(3, 10, 0, 'final', 0)
>>> sys.version_info >= (3, 10)
True
>>> sys.version_info < (3, 8)
False

#sys
