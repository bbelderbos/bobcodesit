# Getting exchange rates

I used Exchange Rates API the other day to convert currencies:

```
from pprint import pprint as pp

import requests
from decouple import config

api_token = config("EXCHANGE_IO_API_TOKEN")  # set in .env

symbols = "AUD,USD"
# base is EUR, I think defaulted to my region
url = f"http://api.exchangeratesapi.io/v1/latest?access_key={api_token}&symbols={symbols}"

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

pp(data["rates"])
# {'AUD': 1.620511, 'USD': 1.098075}
```

#requests
