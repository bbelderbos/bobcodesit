# PEP 723 inline script metadata

Declare script dependencies directly in your Python file with PEP 723 👇

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
#   "pandas>=2.0",
#   "numpy",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def fetch_and_process(url: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Fetch data and process it."""
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Run with uvx (or other PEP 723-compatible runners)
# $ uvx script.py

# Benefits:
# ✓ No separate requirements.txt needed
# ✓ Dependencies are self-documenting
# ✓ Works with modern Python runners
# ✓ Great for single-file scripts and utilities
```

Perfect for standalone scripts, Advent of Code solutions, and quick utilities!

Supported by: uv, pipx, hatch, and other modern Python tools.
