# Convert any Jupyter notebook to Markdown (fast)

If you want to extract a notebook into a clean, shareable text format (great for READMEs, docs, or blog drafts), convert `.ipynb` → Markdown with MyST:

```bash
uvx jupytext --to md:myst polars.ipynb -o polars.md
```

This preserves your markdown cells as headings/paragraphs and turns code cells into fenced code blocks.

Optional: make it a tiny helper:

```bash
nb2md() {
  uvx jupytext --to md:myst "$1" -o "${1%.ipynb}.md"
}
```

#jupyter
