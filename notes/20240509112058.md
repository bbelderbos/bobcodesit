# Add bias to random

`random.choices` can be used to generate random samples with bias.

The `weights` parameter can be used to specify the probability of each item being chosen which is proportional to its weight relative to the sum of all weights.

Here is a simple example:

```
import random
from collections import Counter

# Define the population and corresponding weights
population = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
weights = [10, 1, 1, 1]  # 'apple' is much more likely to be chosen

# Generate a large number of samples
samples = random.choices(population, weights, k=10000)

# Count the occurrences of each item
counter = Counter(samples)

print(counter)
# Counter({'apple': 7748, 'banana': 781, 'cherry': 751, 'orange': 720})
```

#random
