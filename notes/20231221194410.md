# Now is better than never.

Often, you don't truly understand the "real" requirements until you ship code and get users to interact with your software.

That's why it's crucial to drop perfectionism and ship code as soon as possible!

Our platform, 100 Days of Code courses, our community, podcast, PDM/PDI coaching programs... many things we've built over the years could have been delayed by waiting and procrastinating.

Instead, we embraced: "Now is better than never!"

What project have you been putting off that you could start today?

Let's break the cycle of waiting for the perfect moment and take action!
