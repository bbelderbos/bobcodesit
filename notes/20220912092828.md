# walrus operator (3.8)

Since Python 3.8 there is new syntax := that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. It's called "the walrus operator".

In this example we use it in a listcomp avoiding a duplicated call to the double() function:

```
>>> def double(n):
...     return n*2
...
>>> numbers = list(range(1, 11))
>>> numbers
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# old way: calling double() twice
>>> [double(n) for n in numbers if double(n) <= 10]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# new way: using the walrus operator we can use an intermediate variable, calling double() once
>>> [n_doubled for n in numbers if (n_doubled := double(n)) <= 10]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
