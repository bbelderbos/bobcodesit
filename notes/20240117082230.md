# Pretty print code

Look no further: Rich has you covered!

> To syntax highlight code, construct a Syntax object and print it to the console.

For example:

```
from pathlib import Path
from rich.console import Console
from rich.syntax import Syntax

filename = Path.cwd() / 'tips' / 'user.py'  # point to your own file
code = Syntax.from_path(filename)

console = Console()
console.print(code)
```

=> Prints nicely formatted code to terminal.
