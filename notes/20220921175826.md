# method chaining

You can chain methods in Python by having them return "self".

As elegant as it reads (libraries like pandas and sqlalchemy use method chaining), do keep in mind that it can be more difficult to debug methods that are chained.

```
>>> class Calculator:
...
...     def __init__(self, number):
...         self.number = number
...
...     def __str__(self):
...         return f"Number = {self.number}"
...
...     @property
...     def half(self):
...         self.number /= 2
...         return self
...
...     @property
...     def double(self):
...         self.number *= 2
...         return self
...

>>> c = Calculator(10)
>>> print(c)
Number = 10
>>> print(c.double.double)
Number = 40
>>> print(c.double.half.half)
Number = 20.0
```
