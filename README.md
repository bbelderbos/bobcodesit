Coding tips (mainly Python) I share on social media 💪🐍

[Simple workflow I use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxgi12c3sEY)

[Index of all notes](index.md)

To update this, use the [index.py script](index.py).

## What about those code images I post?

They are beautiful, no? All thanks to [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh). I made a [command line script](https://github.com/PyBites-Open-Source/pybites-carbon) to make this even easier / automatable 😄

## What about the repo name?

I own the domain bobcodes.it, it redirects to my homepage bobbelderbos.com. The blog is outdated, but we keep up the blogging [over at Pybites](https://pybit.es/articles/) ...
